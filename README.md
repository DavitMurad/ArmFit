In this project, I explore one of the key components in Apple’s ecosystem: **MapKit**.

ArmFit is a map-based app that showcases some of the best-known fitness centers in Yerevan, Armenia, my hometown.

As someone whose life is split between university and coding on one side, and lifting weights on the other, I had to build something that brings both worlds together.

What started as a playful idea to just mess around with MapKit quickly turned into a functional app with real-world potential, a clean, native experience for anyone looking to explore gyms in Yerevan.

# Technologies Used

**SwiftUI** – entire UI is built natively using modern declarative syntax

**MapKit** – powering the interactive gym location experience across Yerevan

**Combine** – used to simulate API calls and manage async data subscriptions

# Highlights
🧠 Clean MVVM architecture – with clearly separated responsibilities and logic

🧩 Type Extensions everywhere – because I have a thing for tidy, reusable view modifiers

🎬 Custom transitions & animations – smooth flow between views and user actions

💡 SwiftUI materials – used Apple’s native .material styles for elegant, depth-enhanced UI elements

🌍 @EnvironmentObject power – for state-sharing across deeply nested views

🎯 Modular file structure – Models, Views, ViewModels, Services, and Data all living in harmony

💪 Real gym data – real names, real addresses, real facilities, contacts, ready to scale if needed

🌗 Supports both Light and Dark Mode – because aesthetics matter

📱 iPad-friendly UI – fully adaptive layout, no weird stretching or broken views

# Challenges & Learnings

📦 Manual data & media handling – no ready-made API here unfortunetly, had to manage all the gym info, images, and coordinates myself

🗺️ MapKit learning curve – a lot of tutorials online are outdated, so I had to rely on official docs and experiment my way through newer APIs

🙌 Community-driven learning – big thanks to Nick Sarno and his SwiftfulThinking tutorials — a huge help in getting started and staying motivated

# Reflection

This was one of my favourite projects to build it is simple, but even that suits this project. From start to finish, I genuinely enjoyed every part of it: an Armenian-based app, exploring another key Apple component, gym-related content, and of course, SwiftUI.

The process went surprisingly smoothly, a nice change of pace and the result feels clean, useful, and fully mine.

Now it's time to explore another corner of Apple’s ecosystem 🥳

Thanks for stopping by.

Forever a gym rat.

Cheers ✌️
